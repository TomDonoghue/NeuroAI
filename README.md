# NeuroAI

Humans, and other animals, have intelligent behaviour, or a set of capacities to acquire and use knowledge, sometimes referred to generally as 'cognition'.

The longstanding aim of a field now called 'Artificial Intelligence', or AI, is to build artificial systems that have some form of intelligence, with at least some capacity to acquire and use knowledge. This turns out to be a very difficult problem. Though creating 'general intelligence' machines is still elusive, recent has shown a lot of progress in attaining human or super-human level performance on many complex task.

This then raises a series of questions:
- What is the relationship is between neuroscience and AI? Are these artificial system 'intelligent' similar to how we are?
- Can neuroscience help AI to develop new artificially intelligent systems?
- Can AI help neuroscience with understanding how it is that we are intelligent beings?

Current work in AI is often done with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which are abstract computational structures roughly inspired by and similar to biological networks in the brain. Though originally inspired by ideas from neuroscience, modern work in artificial neural nets has diverged considerably from modern work within neuroscience aimed at understanding and modelling biological neural networks.

Partly because of the parallel development of similar concepts across very different fields with different goals and approaches, mapping between current developments in AI and neuroscience requires an interdisciplinary approach that acknowledges the context of specifities of each area, and seeks to understand how they relate to each other.

In this class, we will explore these questions, exploring the relationships between biological and artifical intelligence. We will explore concepts and ideas from both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We will do so in a hands-on and practical approach, embodied through code in Python.
